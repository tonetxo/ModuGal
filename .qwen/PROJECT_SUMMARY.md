# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement spacing, hierarchy, and steampunk-style improvements to the modules page layout by modifying CSS in `src/layouts/ModulesLayout.astro`, specifically increasing vertical spacing between elements and adding depth effects with shadows.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Astro.js static site generator, HTML, CSS, Markdown
- **Project Structure**: Uses Astro layouts with modular content in markdown files (`src/content/modules/*.md`)
- **CSS Architecture**: Component-scoped CSS using Astro's style scoping with data attributes
- **Build Commands**: `npm run build` and `npx astro dev` for development
- **File Locations**: Main layout file at `src/layouts/ModulesLayout.astro`, content files in `src/content/modules/`
- **Specific Selectors**: Using `main.page-content .modules-content .markdown-content h3` pattern for targeting module headings
- **CSS Specificity**: Resolved conflicts by making selectors more specific and avoiding duplicate rules

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Increased vertical spacing for module titles (H3) from 3rem to 4.5rem 
- [DONE] Increased bottom margin for module containers (h3 + ul) from 2.5rem to 3.5rem
- [DONE] Increased padding for parameter list items from 0.8rem to 1rem
- [DONE] Added shadow effects with `box-shadow: 0 5px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)` to both modules content container and sidebar
- [DONE] Fixed CSS specificity issues by removing duplicate rules and making selectors more specific
- [DONE] Built and verified all changes are properly compiled in output CSS
- [DONE] Resolved conflicts with global layout styles from `Layout.astro` that were setting `margin: 0` for headings

## Current Plan
- [DONE] All requested CSS improvements have been implemented and built
- [DONE] Spacing and steampunk styling have been successfully applied to the modules page
- [TODO] User needs to verify changes are visible in browser (may require hard refresh to clear cache)
