## Sound Sources (Oscillators and Generators)

### VCO (Voltage-Controlled Oscillator)
- **Description:** The heart of the synthesizer. It generates the basic waveforms (sawtooth, square, sine, triangle) that form the initial sound. Its pitch is mainly controlled through the `1v/oct` input.
- **Inputs:**
  - `1v/oct`: Controls the main pitch according to the 1 volt per octave standard. Connect a keyboard or sequencer here.
  - `FM1` / `FM2`: Frequency modulation inputs to create complex and metallic timbres (bell-like effects or extreme vibrato).
  - `PWM`: (Square wave only) Modulates the pulse width, changing the character of the sound from thick to thin.
- **Outputs:**
  - `Out`: The main audio signal generated by the oscillator.

### Wavetable
- **Description:** An advanced oscillator that uses a table of waves (an audio sample) as its waveform. It allows creating much more complex and evolving sounds than a standard VCO. It can function as a simple sampler or as a wavetable oscillator.
- **Controls:**
  - `LOAD`: Loads an audio file to use as the wavetable.
  - `LOOP`: Enables or disables the loop mode.
  - `PITCH`: Controls the playback pitch.
  - `XFADE`: Adjusts the crossfade at the loop points to smooth the transition.
- **Inputs:**
  - `1v/oct`: Controls the pitch.
  - `FM`: Frequency modulation.
  - `Gate`: Triggers the playback of the wave (if not in loop mode).
- **Outputs:**
  - `Out`: The audio signal generated.

### Noise Generator
- **Description:** Generates noise of different "colors" (white, pink, random). Essential for creating percussion sounds (like hi-hats or snares), wind effects, or adding texture to other sounds.
- **Outputs:**
  - `Out`: The noise audio signal.

### DrumSynth
- **Description:** A comprehensive 9-channel drum sequencer and synthesizer. It allows programming rhythmic patterns and modifying the sound of each percussion instrument (kick, snare, hi-hat, etc.).

## Modulators (Parameter Control)

### ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release)

### LFO (Low-Frequency Oscillator)

### Sample & Hold (S&H)
- **Description:** A classic modular synthesis module. It "samples" (captures) the voltage value from the `In` input each time it receives a pulse at the `Trig` input, and "holds" (maintains) it at its output until the next pulse. Connected to a noise generator, it produces the typical random sequences of "bleeps" and "bloops".
- **Inputs:**
  - `In`: The CV signal to be sampled.
  - `Trig`: The trigger (gate or clock) signal that indicates when to take a sample.
