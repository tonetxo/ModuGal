## Welcome to ModuGal: Your Modular Sound Universe

ModuGal is a virtual modular synthesizer inspired by classic hardware systems, but with the flexibility and power of modern software. It offers you a blank canvas to design, experiment, and sculpt sounds in an intuitive and visual way. From simple melodies to complex sound textures and generative systems, the only limit is your imagination.

### The Main Canvas: Your Creative Space

When you open the application, you will find the **Keyboard** and **Speakers** modules already pre-loaded so you can start experimenting right away. This is your canvas. This is where you will add and connect modules to build your own instruments and audio systems.

### Interaction and Control

The interaction with the synthesizer is designed to be fast and fluid:

*   **Add Modules:** **Right-click** on any empty space on the canvas to open the selection menu. Navigate through the categories (Oscillators, Filters, Effects, etc.) and click on the module you want to add.
*   **Connect Modules:** **Left-click** on an output of a module and drag the virtual cable to an input of another. Compatible inputs and outputs will be highlighted to guide you. To disconnect a cable, you can click on its input connection point or directly on the cable itself.
*   **Canvas Navigation:**
    *   *Zoom:* Use the **mouse wheel** to zoom in or out, allowing you to get an overview of your patch or focus on specific details.
    *   *Pan:* Hold down the **left mouse button** on any empty part of the canvas and drag to pan.
*   **Interact with Modules:** **Left-click** and drag the knobs, faders, or switches to modify the parameters of each module in real time. Watch and listen to how your changes affect the sound.
*   **Module Menu:** **Right-click** on the header of any module to access additional options, such as duplicating, deleting, or viewing specific information.

### Understanding the Signal Flow

In a modular synthesizer, everything is based on how the signal flows. There are two main types of signals, differentiated by their color: **Audio** (blue cables), which is the sound you hear, and **CV (Control Voltage)** (orange cables), which are control signals used to modulate parameters. By convention, outputs are on the right side of the modules and inputs are on the left. The goal is to guide the audio signal from a source (like a VCO) through various processors (like a VCF or VCA) to a final output (like the Speaker module).

### Limitless Exploration

The true magic of a modular synthesizer lies in experimentation. There is no "correct" way to do things. Connect outputs to unexpected inputs, modulate parameters to the extreme, and discover new sound palettes. Enjoy the journey!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What platforms is ModuGal available on?**

A: Currently, ModuGal is available as a desktop application for **Windows** (self-installing executable) and **Linux** (AppImage format). We are working to offer a version for macOS in the future.

**Q: Do I need prior synthesis knowledge to use ModuGal?**

A: Not necessarily. ModuGal is designed to be intuitive for both beginners and experts. The visual interface makes it easy to understand the signal flow. However, having basic synthesis concepts will help you get the most out of it.

**Q: Can I use my own samples in the Wavetable module?**

A: Yes! The Wavetable module allows you to load your own audio files in WAV format to use as oscillators.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem: The application produces no sound.**

1.  **Check the audio connection:** Make sure the modules are correctly connected from a sound source (like a VCO) to the main output.
2.  **Check the ADSR:** Verify that the ADSR envelope is being triggered by a sequencer or MIDI keyboard and that its gain output is connected to the VCA.
3.  **Check the volume:** Ensure the main volume control is not set to zero.

**Problem: The application closes unexpectedly.**

A: Please help us improve ModuGal. If you experience an unexpected closure, send us an email at `support@modugal.com` with the steps you took before the closure and, if possible, attach the log file located at `~/.config/ModuGal/logs/main.log`.
